If 13 was an aberration of day 1, day 2 saw 18 wickets going down. SA managed to get ahead in the game with a lead of 68 but then frittered it quickly by being bowled out for 128 and hand their opponents a target of 197. Lakmal starred for Lanka as he picked up four wickets. And then Dhananjaya de Silva filled up for Embuldeniya by scalping three wickets. Like the first innings, the visitors got off to a decent start before losing their openers in quick succession. With 40 percent chances of rain tomorrow, chances are it might well be a curtailed day. But only 137 runs are needed for Lanka to script something for the ages. Can SA stop the Lankan juggernaut? We will come back tomorrow for the answers.
